# FolderMaker

In my work I often meet the situation that some network drive needs to set up a folder structure with names of documents. If the documents are in excess of 30, this is a silly repetative task that is well suited for a program or script. Not everyone knows how to use shell scripting (escpecially not casual windows users, such as engineers, purchasing dept etc.)

I took it upon myself to make a small functional tool for such people, that would spare them the pain of having set up multiple folders while creating a folder structure.

First version will be very simple. Features I am planning to add.
- GUI with file and directory selector
- Preview of the folder structure
- Ability to initialize each folder with a configurable file
